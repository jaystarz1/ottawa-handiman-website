# üöÄ Essential SEO Setup for Every Website

## Core Files (Always)
- **robots.txt** - Controls crawler access
- **sitemap.xml** - Helps search engines find all pages
- **favicon** - Brand identity in browser tabs

## Search Console Verification (Always)
- **Google Search Console** - Monitor Google search performance
- **Bing Webmaster Tools** - Don't ignore Bing's 6-7% market share
- Submit your sitemap to both after verification

## Meta Tags (Always)
- Title tag (unique for each page)
- Meta description (compelling, under 160 chars)
- Open Graph tags (for social media sharing)
- Schema markup (structured data for rich results)

## Analytics (Always)
- **Google Analytics** or similar - Track visitor behavior
- Helps you understand what's working

## Performance Basics (Always)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Fast loading (optimize images, minimize CSS/JS)
- HTTPS (secure connection)

## üìà Why This Matters

Without these basics:
- Search engines might not find your site
- You won't know if anyone visits
- Social media shares look broken
- You're invisible to 93% of online experiences (which start with search)

## ‚è±Ô∏è When to Do It

**IMMEDIATELY after launch!** The sooner you set up:
- The faster you get indexed
- The sooner you gather data
- The quicker you can optimize

Think of it like opening a store - you wouldn't open without a sign, right? This is your digital signage and customer tracking system.

**Pro tip:** Create a template with all these files ready to customize for each new project. Saves time and ensures you never forget!
